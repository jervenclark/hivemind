Stanford EE104 - Intro to Machine Learning Notes - Lecture 2

The main goal of artificial intelligence is to have the machine do some tasks
Two approaches to AI
- knowledge-based - a computer program whose logic encodes a large number of properties of the world, usually developed by a team of domain experts over many years
- machine learning - extract information from historical data and extrapolate to make predictions

Machine learning tasks:
- build a model from some data
	- choose how to map raw data to feature vectors
		  this step, we need to convert the data in such a way that the computer understands
		  for example when dealing with x-rays, we can either just feed it the actual image in form of pixel data or we can do more sophisticated steps like encoding additional data for example the center of mass of the image, lengths/widths of various parts, what we choose to be informative features of the data
	- choose a model form
		  figuring out what class of model we would like to have
		  there are very simple models like linear regression where we just fit a straight line over our data and   describe the slope of the line and the intercept of the line where we just have 2 numbers to describe the model. these 2 numbers will be parameter values that parameterized the model
		  alternatively, we might describe the model as a tree, as a neural network
	- choose parameter values in the model
- test or validate the model
	- evaluate the model on unseen data to assess its performance


Machine learning model taxonomy
Key categorization of machine learning:
- supervised models
	- predict something given some others
	- called a prediction model
		- called regression when we predict a real scalar or vector value
		- called classification when we predict a value from a finite set such as True or False
	- we can use estimates:
		- we can either use point estimate
		- we can use probability estimates which is then used to create a point estimate
			- the advantage of a probability estimate is that you can incorporate your own tolerance with the prediction
- unsupervised models
	- called data model
		- they dont predict the data but they can tell if a new unseen data belongs to the current existing data
		- they have the capability to generate new synthetic data records


Examples:
- predict tomorrow's rainfall given the date and the last 10 days of rainfall
- determine from a photo of a face

Performance Metrics
- Mean square or RMS for regression
- Error rate for classification
- log likelihood for probabilistic model
