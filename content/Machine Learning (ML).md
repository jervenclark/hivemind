## Overview

Most generally, Machine Learning is what its name implies - it is a scientific discipline that is a sub-field of [[Artificial Intelligence (AI)]] and [[Computer Science]], which endeavors to teach computers how to learn and perform tasks without being explicitly programmed using statistical models and computational techniques. So instead of following a rigid set of rules, machine learning algorithms are trained on data which they use to identify and uncover patterns and make predictions. 

Machine learning is also known across business problems under the name Predictive Analytics and is closely related to [[Data Mining]]. Although not all of machine learning is statistically based, [[Computational Statistics]] is an important source of the fields methodologies.

From a theoretical point of view, [[Probably Approximately Correct Learning]] provides a framework for describing machine learning.
## Traditional Approaches

Machine learning approaches have been applied to a wide variety of problems and interests including large language models, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, medicine, among others where it is very costly to develop algorithms to perform the needed tasks. 

These approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the "signal" or "feedback" that is being evaluated by the system
- [[Supervised Learning]] is when the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs
- [[Unsupervised Learning]] is when no labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its inputs. Unsupervised learning can also be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning)
- [[Reinforcement Learning]] is when a computer interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing with an opponent. As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.

Although each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems.
