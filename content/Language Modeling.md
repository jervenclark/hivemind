## Overview
Language modeling is the use of various statistical and probabilistic techniques to determine the probability of a given sequence of words occurring in a sentence. Language models analyze bodies of text data to provide a basis for their word predictions.

Language modeling is used in [[Artificial Intelligence (AI)]], [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)]], [[Natural Language Understanding]] and [[Natural Language Generation]] systems, particularly ones that perform text generation, machine translation and question answering.

## Language Modeling Types
There are several approaches to building language models. Some common statistical language modeling types are:
- [[N-gram]]
- [[Unigram]]
- [[Bidirectional]]
- [[Exponential]]
- [[Neural Language Models]]
- [[Continuous Space]]
